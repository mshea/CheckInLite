# Check In Lite #

This is a simple app that lets people check in to a location. Users can create new locations, check in to one of the last three locations, or view all the people who have checked in.

*To Do*
* Figure out authentication
* Fix the buttons on the individual user screen
* Show time last checked in on user index screen
* Figure out a way to show all users on Google Maps
* Remove tables from user index and show them in a longer list
* Figure out a better way to do deleting. Swipe would be nice but then I'd need to learn javascript.
* Dump this project and just use Latitude.
